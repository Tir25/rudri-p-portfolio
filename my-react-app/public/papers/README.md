# Paper PDFs Directory

This directory contains PDF files for academic papers. In a real implementation, you would place the actual PDF files here.

For now, the links in the application will point to these non-existent files, but in a production environment, you would:

1. Upload the actual PDF files here
2. Name them according to the IDs in the papers.js data file
3. Ensure proper access permissions are set

## Example Files

The application expects files like:
- statistical-methods-2024.pdf
- bayesian-inference-2023.pdf
- multivariate-analysis-2023.pdf
- etc.
